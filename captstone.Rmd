# Check if the NAs in the Ratings are missing at Random in the Footnote

* footnote with levels are inducing the NAs in the dataset: 
+ "Data are shown only for hospitals that participate in the Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) and Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) programs" is inducing the NAs across the dataset, 
+ "Data suppressed by CMS for one or more quarters"

* This enables us to conclude that the provider ids related this level can be purged from the dataset

```{r}
general_info_cleaned %>% filter(general_info_cleaned$Hospital.overall.rating.footnote %in% 
           c("Data are shown only for hospitals that participate in the Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) and Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) programs",
             "Data suppressed by CMS for one or more quarters")) %>% group_by(Hospital.overall.rating,Mortality.national.comparison,Readmission.national.comparison,Safety.of.care.national.comparison,Efficient.use.of.medical.imaging.national.comparison,Timeliness.of.care.national.comparison,Effectiveness.of.care.national.comparison,Patient.experience.national.comparison) %>% 
  summarise(count_rws = n()) %>% t()

general_info_cleaned <- general_info_cleaned %>%

             "Data suppressed by CMS for one or more quarters"))

```

* Similarly, "Data suppressed by CMS for one or more quarters" also cannot be used for analysis as this is inducing the NAs across the datasets, which mandates to purge the dataset with missing NAs

```{r}
barplot(prop.table(table(general_info_cleaned$Hospital.overall.rating)))
```

* Barplot of the ratings show that the Hospital rating has a gaussian distribution

* checking the level footnote level of Hospital Rating 
  - "There are too few measures or measure groups reported to calculate a star rating or measure group score"
  - "Results are not available for this reporting period"

```{r}
general_info_cleaned %>% 
  filter(general_info_cleaned$Hospital.overall.rating.footnote %in% 
           c("Results are not available for this reporting period",
             "There are too few measures or measure groups reported to calculate a star rating or measure group score")) %>% summary()
```
* The above specific additional footnotes also contribute to the NAs in Hospital Overall Rating with multilevel dependency on the other groups. 
* For example, specified ones below contribue less to NAs, compared to Mortality, Safety of care, Readmission, Efficient Use of medical Imaging.
  + "Patient.experience" , "Effectiveness.of.care", "Timeliness.of.care"

```{r}
general_info_cleaned <- general_info_cleaned %>%

           c("Results are not available for this reporting period",
             "There are too few measures or measure groups reported to calculate a star rating or measure group score")) 

summary(general_info_cleaned)

```

1. We thus have conclusively arrived at the "general_info_final" dataset with 1-5 hospital ratings imputing the NAs
2. Picking the hospital Rating from the general info cleaned dataset 

```{r}
z_rem_var1 <- which(names(general_info_cleaned) %in% c("Provider.ID","Hospital.overall.rating"))
general_info_final <- general_info_cleaned[is.na(general_info_cleaned$Hospital.overall.rating.footnote),z_rem_var1]

# Analysing the Complications dataset

```{r}

                             header = T,check.names = T,stringsAsFactors = T,na.strings = c('Not Available',""))
head(complications_df)
```

* Cleaning the demographic variables that do not have an impact on the Measure IDs

```{r}

zdemographics <- c("Hospital.Name","Address","City","State","ZIP.Code","County.Name","Phone.Number","Measure.Start.Date", "Measure.End.Date")
zdemogrphic_vars <- which(names(complications_df) %in% zdemographics)

```
- Measuring the distribution of NAs in the Complications dataset, Compared to National, and Footnote variables.
- About 35% of the NAs in Compared to National, and 41% of the records in footnote is stale due to reasons specified in the variable.

```{r}
round(prop.table(summary(factor(complications_df_cleaned$Compared.to.National)))*100,2)  #- Thus NAs are 35% in the Compared.To.National variable
round(prop.table(summary(factor(complications_df_cleaned$Footnote)))*100,2)  #- NAs are 65% in the Footnote variable 
```

### imputation of NAs in Complications dataset
- Analysis of "footnote" variable by checking the impact on the score variable

```{r}
# Distribution of Score and Denominator by Footnote
complications_df_cleaned %>% group_by(Footnote) %>% 
  summarise(cnt_rows = n(),Avg_Score = mean(Score,na.rm = T),Total_Score = sum(Score,na.rm = T)) %>% arrange(Avg_Score)

```

- Footnote Variable: Footnote levels which have specific reasons do not contribute to score variable for the specific Provided.ID,
these rows can be imputed from analysis.

```{r}
zvar1 <- is.na(complications_df$Footnote) # Blank Footnotes
zvar2 <- which(names(complications_df_cleaned) %in% "Footnote")
complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas <- complications_df_cleaned[zvar1,-zvar2]

summary(complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas)
```
- Imputing the "NAs" resulted in inducing the variability in each of the variables. 

# which variable is contributing most NAs  in "Score" variable?

```{r}
library(reshape2)
complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas %>% group_by(Measure.ID) %>% 
  summarise(cnt_rws = n(), Sum_score = sum(Score,na.rm = T),
            mean_Score = mean(Score,na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(cnt_rws)) %>% melt(value.name = c("value")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Measure.ID,y = value)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(facets = ~ variable,scales = "free",ncol = 3) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,vjust = 0.5,hjust = 1))


complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas[is.na(complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas$Denominator),] %>% summary()

```

- Significant Measures from these measure Ids are "PSI_90_SAFETY","PSI_4_SURG_COMP" "COMP_HIP_KNEE" is the other significant measure

- rejecting the Denominoator, Lower Estimate, Higher Estimate, Compared.to.National variables
- Important measures are 

```{r}

zvar1 <- c( "Provider.ID", "Measure.ID", "Score")
zvar2 <- which(names(complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas) %in% zvar1)

complications_df_final <-  complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas[,zvar2] %>%  spread(key = Measure.ID,value = Score)
summary(complications_df_final)

```

```{r}
library(psych)
pairs.panels(x = complications_df_final[2:ncol(complications_df_final)],
             bg = rainbow(n = 12),
             smooth = TRUE,
             ellipses = TRUE,pch = 21,cex.cor = 0.05,cex.labels = 0.5)
cor.plot(complications_df_final[,-1],numbers = T,show.legend = F,cex = 0.7,xlas = 2,cex.axis = 0.7)

```

- Some of the variables exhibit that high variability compared to other measures are for example, "PSI_90_SAFETY","COMP_HIP_KNEE", "PSI_4_SURG_COMP" 
- Considering the signficant variable measures from these Complications Dataset

```{r}
zvar1 <- which(names(complications_df_spread) %in% c("Provider.ID","PSI_90_SAFETY","COMP_HIP_KNEE","PSI_4_SURG_COMP"))

```

* There are abnormal outliers in the dataset from the measure IDs HAI_1_DOPC_Days, besides this they do not contribute to the overall score
- Summarise the distribution of the mueasures.

- A central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is a serious infection that occurs when germs (usually bacteria or viruses) enter the bloodstream through the central line. Healthcare providers must follow a strict protocol when inserting the line to make sure the line remains sterile and a CLABSI does not occur. In addition to inserting the central line properly, healthcare providers must use stringent infection control practices each time they check the line or change the dressing. Patients who get a CLABSI have a fever, and might also have red skin and soreness around the central line. If this happens, healthcare providers can do tests to learn if there is an infection present.

-Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacteria that causes diarrhea and can lead to serious complications. Those at highest risk for C. difficile infection include people who take antibiotics and also receive care in any medical setting, including hospitals. C. difficile bacteria produce spores that can be spread from patient to patient. Symptoms from C. diff infections often take a few days to develop. Patients are tested for C. diff. infections if they show signs of illness while in the hospital. This measure compares the number of stool specimens that tested positive for C. diff toxin four or more days after the patient entered the hospital to a national benchmark.

- CAUTI -Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infections: A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection involving any part of the urinary system, including urethra, bladder, ureters, and kidney. UTIs are the most common type of healthcare-associated infection reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).  Among UTIs acquired in the hospital, approximately 75% are associated with a urinary catheter, which is a tube inserted into the bladder through the urethra to drain urine.  Between 15-25% of hospitalized patients receive urinary catheters during their hospital stay.  The most important risk factor for developing a catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) is prolonged use of the urinary catheter.  Therefore, catheters should only be used for appropriate indications and should be removed as soon as they are no longer needed.

- Considering the SIRs, that Centre for Diesease Control and Prevention uses to calculate, Standard Infection Ratio (SIR) which takes into account patient care location, number of patients with an exisiting infection, lab mehtords, bed size, afficialiton with a medical schools, bed size of the hospital, age of patients.

- central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), catheter- associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), surgical site infection (SSI) from colon surgery or abdominal hysterectomy, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) blood laboratory-identified events (bloodstream infections), and Clostridium difficile (C.diff.) laboratory-identified events (intestinal infections). The HAI measures show how often patients in a particular hospital contract certain infections during the couse of their medical treatment

HAI_1_SIR, HAI_1a_SIR, HAI_2_SIR, HAI_2a_SIR, HAI_6_SIR,HAI_4_SIR, HAI_5_SIR, HAI_3_SIR

HAI-1 measure tracks central-line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) in ICUs and select wards. 
HAI-2 measure tracks catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) in ICUs and select wards. 
HAI-3 Surgical Site Infection from colon surgery (SSI: Colon)
HAI-4 Surgical Site Infection from abdominal hysterectomy (SSI: Hysterectomy)
HAI-5 Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Blood Laboratory-identified Events (Bloodstream infections)
HAI-6 Clostridium difficile (C.diff.) Laboratory-identified Events (Intestinal infections)

zvar1 <-  which(names(time_and_eff_care_imputed) %in% c("Provider.ID","Measure.ID","Score"))

timeliness_group <- time_and_eff_care_imputed[,zvar1] %>% spread(key = Measure.ID,value = Score)

zvar1 <- which(names(timeliness_group) %in% c("Provider.ID","ED_1b","ED_2b","OP_18b", "OP_3b", "OP_5", "OP_20","OP_21"))
zvar2 <- which(names(timeliness_group) %in% c("Provider.ID","CAC_3","IMM_2","IMM_3_OP_27_FAC_ADHPCT","OP_22","OP_23","OP_29","OP_30","OP_4","PC_01","STK_1", "STK_4", "STK_6","STK_8","VTE_1","VTE_2","VTE_3","VTE_5", "VTE_6"))

effectiveness_group <- timeliness_group[,zvar2]
timeliness_group <- timeliness_group[,zvar1]


```

* check the correlation between the measure variables

```{r}
pairs.panels(x = timeliness_group[2:length(zvar1)],cex.cor = 0.5,cex.labels = 0.9,ellipses = TRUE,pch = 21,bg = rainbow(length(zvar1)), main = "Timeliness Group variable correlation" )
```
- most of the measure variables of timeliness group are uncorrelated.
- ED_1B and ED_2B are the inversely correlated to some extent as the timespent in the emergency room is the common between them. They are inversely correlated as the doctors visit reduces the time spend by the patient before moving to ED to inpatient room is reduced.

```{r}
zvar1 <- which(names(effectiveness_group) %in% "IMM_3_OP_27_FAC_ADHPCT")
names(effectiveness_group)[zvar1] <- "IMM_3_OP_27"

```

```{r}
cor.plot(effectiveness_group[,-1],
        stars = FALSE,numbers = TRUE,colors = TRUE,cex = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE,
         xlas = 2,cex.axis = 0.6,main = "Effectiveness group measure correlation")

```
- Variables represented by the effectiveness group have small degree of correlation

- Merging the timliness group and effectiveness group with master dataframe

```{r}
# merging master dataframe with timliness group
master_df <- merge(x = master_df,y = timeliness_group,by = intersect(names(master_df),names(timeliness_group)),all = TRUE)

# merging master dataframe with effectiveness group
master_df <- merge(x = master_df,y = effectiveness_group,by = intersect(names(master_df),names(effectiveness_group)),all = TRUE)
summary(master_df)
```

# Analysing the Readmission and Mortality groups

```{r}

head(readm_mort_df)
```

* Purging the demographic variables not needed in the analysis 

```{r}
zdemogrphic_vars <- which(names(readm_mort_df) %in% c(zdemographics,"Measure.Name","Compared.to.National"))
readm_mort_cleaned <- readm_mort_df[,-zdemogrphic_vars]

```

* Analysing the footnote variable

```{r}
summary(readm_mort_cleaned)

```
### Imputing the NAs

* Considering the Footnote variable as the reference variable. Assuming that the levels specified below encapsulate the NAs in the dataset. A summary rollover on the dataset breifs the situation that below levels holds NAs

 1 - The number of cases/patients is too few to report.
19 - Data are shown only for hospitals that participate in the Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) and Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) programs.
 4 - Data suppressed by CMS for one or more quarters.  
 5 - Results are not available for this reporting period.
 7 - No cases met the criteria for this measure.


```{r}
readm_mort_cleaned[!is.na(readm_mort_cleaned$Footnote),] %>% group_by(Footnote) %>% summarise(cnt_rows = n(),avg_score = mean(Score))
```

* imputing the rows that are as a reslut of stale data from different levels of footnotes
```{r}
readm_mort_cleaned <- readm_mort_cleaned[is.na(readm_mort_cleaned$Footnote),]
```


```{r}
ggplot(readm_mort_cleaned,aes(Measure.ID,Score)) + geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "Mortality Readmission Rate Score") + ylab(label = "Provider Count") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,vjust = 1,hjust = 1),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 
```

* Plotting the Measure variables

```{r}
ggplot(readm_mort_cleaned,aes(Measure.ID)) + geom_bar() + labs(title = "Mortality Readmission Rate Count by Providers") + ylab(label = "Provider Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,vjust = 1,hjust = 1),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 
```

* *Readmission* measure that contribute to the overall count are:

READM-30-AMI 	Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 30-Day Readmission Rate 
READM-30-COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 30-Day Readmission Rate 
READM-30-CABG Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) 30-Day Readmission Rate 
READM-30-HF 	Heart Failure (HF) 30-Day Readmission Rate 
READM-30-Hip-Knee 	Hospital-Level 30-Day All-Cause Risk- Standardized Readmission Rate (RSRR) Following Elective Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA)/ Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) 
READM-30-PN 	Pneumonia (PN) 30-Day Readmission Rate 
READM-30-STK 	Stroke (STK) 30-Day Readmission Rate 
READM-30-HOSP-WIDE 	HWR Hospital-Wide All-Cause Unplanned Readmission

* *Mortality* group that contribute to Overall Hospital Rating are:
MORT-30-AMI 	Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 30-Day Mortality Rate 
MORT-30-CABG 	Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) 30-Day Mortality Rate 
MORT-30-COPD 	Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 30-Day Mortality Rate 
MORT-30-HF 	Heart Failure (HF) 30-Day Mortality Rate 
MORT-30-PN 	Pneumonia (PN) 30-Day Mortality Rate 
MORT-30-STK 	Acute Ischemic Stroke (STK) 30-Day Mortality Rate

pairs.panels(readmission_grp[,-1],scale = TRUE,ellipses = TRUE,pch = 21,bg = rainbow(n = ncol(readmission_grp)),cex.labels = 0.7)
```

* All varaibles in the dataset are significant and thus are being retained into the final dataframe
* Two variables that are significant and strong correlation between them are: 
+ 1. Readmission_Hospital_Wide and Readm_PN death rate
+ 2. Readmission-after discharge and Heart Failure
+ 3. Readmission after discharge and COPD

Ailments are significantly correlated.

* Combining the mortality and readmission group with the master dataframe.

```

```{r}
summary(op_imaging_eff_cleaned)

* NA imputation in the Score variables
* which measures Scores have NAs? 
In order to check the NAs, Footnote is taken as reference to validate the NAs

```{r}
op_imaging_eff_cleaned[is.na(op_imaging_eff_cleaned$Footnote),] %>% summary()
op_imaging_eff_cleaned[!is.na(op_imaging_eff_cleaned$Score),] %>% summary()
```

*  From the summary we can infer that most of the NAs in the score are induced by Stale data represented by different classess of Footnotes
```{r}
op_imaging_eff_cleaned <- op_imaging_eff_cleaned[is.na(op_imaging_eff_cleaned$Footnote),] 
```
# Plotting the trends of Measure Variables acorss the providers

```
* Checking the variability
```{r}
pairs.panels(op_imaging_eff_final[,-1],scale = T,smooth = T,density = T,ellipses = T,pch = 21,method = 'pearson',cex.labels = 1,cex.cor = 1)

```
* Data variablility is uniform acorss the dataset except the Op_10 and OP-11 measure which are closely correlated with skewed distribution

* Merging the imaging the dataframe with Master_dataframe

```{r}
master_df <- merge(x = master_df,y = op_imaging_eff_final,by = intersect(x = names(master_df),y = names(op_imaging_eff_final)),all = TRUE) #%>% head()
```
1. check outliers in the measures
2. imputing missing values


```{r}
master_df[is.na(master_df$Hospital.overall.rating),] %>% summary()
```

# which rows have all NAs?

```{r}
na_indices <- apply(master_df[,-c(1,2)], MARGIN = 1, function(x) all(is.na(x)))
sum(na_indices)

```

```{r}
paste0(round(prop.table(table(master_df$Hospital.overall.rating))*100,2),"%")
```

```{r}

master_df_imputed_final <-  complete(data = master_df_imputed,action = 5)
head(master_df_imputed_final)
```

- Replacing NAs in the target variable Hospital.Overall.Rating to "Missing"

```{r}
ratings <- as.character(master_df$Hospital.overall.rating)

ratings[which(is.na(ratings))] <- "Missing"
master_df$Hospital.overall.rating <- factor(ratings)
